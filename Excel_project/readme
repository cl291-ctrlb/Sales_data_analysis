🚀 Sales Data Analysis: Insights

I recently completed an in-depth analysis of our sales dataset, and here’s what I discovered while working with thousands of rows of data:

Key Steps I Took:

Used Find & Replace to clean data efficiently, removing commas from numbers (e.g., 13,999 → 13999) and differentiating True/False values to filter rows.

Checked for null or blank values and expanded collapsed data with the plus icon for easy review.

Converted text-based numbers to numeric format for accurate calculations.

Deleted unnecessary columns like Username and Review ID to focus on relevant metrics.

Filtered and validated images and links to identify genuine data.

Applied formulas to analyze percentages (e.g., IF(F2>60%, "more than 60", "less than 60")).

Created multiple pivot tables for visual insights and better segmentation.

Category-wise Observations:

Capc USB Cables dominated the dataset with 231 rows, followed by Ew Smart Watches (76 rows) and Eht Smart Televisions (62 rows).

Smaller categories like Ehac RCACables and Ehat TVWallCeilingMounts had very few entries, indicating niche products.

Analysis Questions I Explored:

Which categories offer the highest discounts?

Which categories have the highest customer satisfaction?

Do higher discounts improve ratings
